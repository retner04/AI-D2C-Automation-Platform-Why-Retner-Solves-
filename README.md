# The Real Problem with the D2C Tool Landscape

D2C brands rarely fail due to lack of tools.

They fail because their tools don’t talk to each other.

Most brands end up stacking:

- One WhatsApp tool  
- One support tool  
- One marketing tool  
- One analytics tool  

Each solves a slice — not the journey.

# The 3 Categories of D2C Tools (And Their Limits)

## 1. WhatsApp-First D2C Tools  
**Examples:** Interakt, QuickReply.ai, DelightChat  

### What they do well
- Inbox management  
- Notifications & broadcasts  
- Basic automation  

### Where they stop
- No intent understanding  
- No behavior awareness  
- No decision logic  

They manage conversations — not decisions.

---

## 2. Support-Focused AI Tools  
**Example:** Gorgias (AI)

### What they do well
- Ticket resolution  
- Faster support responses  

### Where they stop
- Support ≠ revenue  
- No proactive decision handling  

They react to problems — they don’t prevent them.

---

## 3. Enterprise Conversational AI Platforms  
**Examples:** Kore.ai, Cognigy  

### What they do well
- Deep AI capabilities  
- Complex workflows  

### Where they stop (for startups)
- High cost  
- Long setup cycles  
- Built for banks & enterprises, not carts & COD  

Powerful — but overkill for D2C.
